# Putting It All Together

Start simple – Build an MLP in NumPy to understand forward / backward flow.
Progress to PyTorch – Re‑implement the same model using nn.Module; you’ll get automatic gradients.
Add complexity gradually – Conv layers → RNN → Transformer.
Regularise & optimize – Momentum, Adam, weight decay.
Experiment – Try different architectures, hyper‑parameters, datasets.
Deploy – Export, test on mobile or web.
